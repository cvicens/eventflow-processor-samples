# Event Flow Operations/Processors

Sample container showing data-stream-processing for the Event-Flow Manager

## Installation

Once the `Event-flow` APB is deployed, run `mvn package` from this directory. This will deploy the Java based operations.

For each project, do an upload of the `streamzi.yml` in the `manager` UI component!

TODO: how to deploy the Node.js operations?
